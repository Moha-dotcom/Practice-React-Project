      text: 'I had the first Osmo Pocket for two years and I really enjoyed it, it had a few downsides though like when a room was even a little dim, you could see visual noise in the footage and photos. Also whether you were outside or inside, the contrast and exposure were sometimes all over the place. The only way to TRY to fix it was to adjust the settings manually for each shot...but even then...there were limitations.'

      text : 'This Osmo Pocket 2 is much better in the sense that when I filmed the same dim rooms or low light settings, the camera performed much better with little to no visual noise. The contrast and exposures are much more even. If you\'re filming a landscape that is in shadow, but there\'s a bright sky, this Osmo Pocket will adjust the light so you can see the ground and landscape -which is an improvement because the last pocket would adjust for the sky and make the landscape look even darker.'

      text : 'I bought this camera for my YouTube channel Rishank Ponnanna. I have a Sony A6000 with a dji ronin sc setup which is quite heavy to carry around for vlogging and other needs. I won\'t compare the quality between the two as that\'s a Mirror less camera with a 30k lens attached to it but this tiny monster is amazing in its own way. Its super tiny and easy to carry. No one really notices it so vlogging is very easy. I\'ve not yet transferred the footages to my computer as I got it today and shot my vlog today, but the video will go up on my channel soon, so you can watch it there. The wide angle helps take some great shots and the pro mode is fabulous as well. It struggles during low light but it didn\'t bother me much because of how small and easy to carry and use it is.'
